# DIII XC Nationals Prediction Model

## Project Description

This project aims to predict finishing times and placements at the Division III Cross Country National Championship meet using data from the 2024 and 2025 seasons. The data is sourced from LACCTiC (a comprehensive cross country results database) and analyzed using statistical modeling techniques.

This is a final project for **MATH348: Data Science with R**, with all analysis and modeling primarily conducted in R.
