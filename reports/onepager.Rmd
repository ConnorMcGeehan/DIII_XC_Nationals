## Overview

This project uses historical race data to build a predictive model that forecasts the top 40 finishers; All-Americans, at the NCAA Division III Cross Country National Championships in 2025. By analyzing performance trends, athlete progression, and race conditions, we aim to provide a model that rivals existing prediction systems like LACCTiC.

## Data

We will use data collected from the LACCTiC API. This API gives us access to meet results and specific athlete's racing history. We will use this to collect the following information about each athlete:

-   **Athlete ID** – A unique identifier for each athlete

-   **Athlete Name** – The name of the Athlete

-   **Athlete Class** – Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior, Graduate Student

-   **School** – NCAA Division III institution

Additionally, we will collect race results for each athlete who raced at the national championship. These results will include:

-   **Athlete ID** – A unique identifier for each athlete

-   **Race Distance** – Typically 8k for men, but varies by race

-   **Time** – Official race finish time in seconds

-   **Place** – The position that the athlete finished the race in

-   Head-to-head performance comparisons

-   Season progression metrics

## Questions

Who is going to be an All-American at the DIII 2025 XC National meet?

How does our model compare to the predictions created by LACCTiC?

## Stakeholders

Stakeholders could include a wide variety of people:

-   NCAA XC Coaches and Athletes

-   XC Fans and Spectators

-   High School Recruits interested in how different programs perform

-   Administrators and Athletics Departments from competing schools

## KPIs

-   Accuracy of model overall

-   Accuracy of model in comparison to LACCTiC

-   Models accuracy compared to predictions based off 8k season bests
