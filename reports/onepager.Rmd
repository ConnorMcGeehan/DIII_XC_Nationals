## Overview

This project leverages historical race data to build a predictive model that forecasts the top 50 finishers—All-Americans, at the NCAA Division III Cross Country National Championships in 2025. By analyzing performance trends, athlete progression, and race conditions, we aim to provide a data-driven forecast that rivals existing prediction systems like LACCTiC.

## Data

We use publicly available meet results from the **Track & Field Results Reporting System (TFFRS)**, which includes:

-   **Athlete Name** – Unique identifier for performance tracking

-   **Athlete Class** – Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior

-   **School** – NCAA Division III institution

-   **Race Distance** – Typically 8k for men, 6k for women

-   **Time** – Official race finish time

Additional derived features include:

-   Course difficulty adjustments

-   Weather conditions

-   Head-to-head performance comparisons

-   Season progression metrics

## Questions

Who is going to be an All-American at the DIII 2025 XC National meet?

How does our model compare to the predictions created by LACCTiC?

## Stakeholders

Stakeholders could include a wide variety of people:

-   NCAA XC Coaches and Athletes

-   XC Fans and Spectators

-   High School Recruits interested in how different programs perform

-   Administrators and Athletics Departments from competing schools

## KPIs

-   Accuracy of model overall

-   Accuracy of model in comparison to LACCTiC

-   Models accuracy compared to predictions based off 8k season bests
